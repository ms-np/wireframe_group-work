# Group work: building a website
> A simple project of building a website to match the wireframe and to make each team member responsible for one step.

## Who are we? :hatching_chick:
We're two enthusiastic HYF students - **Alex** and **Nadia** and we're glad to present you our common effort on building a website on a shared Github repository.

## What have we tried and learnt during this project?
* set up a new Github repository from the [template](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/w3-validation-template)
* upload and update the wireframe in the project with the [wireframe tool](https://wireframe.cc/)
* create a substantial [README file](README.md) to present our project
* create our custom [Development strategy](development-strategy.md) from the initial [template](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/incremental-development/blob/master/integrate/development-strategy-semantic-layout.md)
* practice to collaboratively contribute the the _project on Github_:
   * raise and close the issues
   * resolve the conflicts while merging
   * assign each other on the pull requests
   * review each other work and approving merges
* validating HTML and CSS code of the website. 

## What have we reached so far? :star-struck:

#### Find out [the live version](https://ms-np.github.io/wireframe_group-work/) of the Group website.

## Why have we done this?
We've finished this project in order to learn something new, to make mistakes and to encourage you to contribute to our [Group website](https://ms-np.github.io/wireframe_group-work/).
